# A CIRCLE OF FIFTHS (WIP)

A web page that features an interactive version of the [Circle of Fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths), written to have fun with music theory and practice CSS and Javascript (and perhaps Python, later on).

## Features
---
Currently, features a circle with selectable labels for both major and minor keys, (drawn entirely in CSS! see [Resources](#Resources) below)
    
## TODO
---
- [x] 'Hollowing out' the center of the circle.
- [x] Add an 'inner ring' for minor keys.
- [ ] Label each section with a key and its signature, possibly as part of a continuous staff that loops around the circle, which would require =>
- [ ] Add a clef that stays stable while the circle spins.
- [ ] Have the circle spin to focus and center a selected key.
- [ ] Be able to select/move to a random key.
