https://clavierbulb-green.github.io/A-Circle-of-Fifths/

Currently, features a circle with a circular staff with the key-signatures of each key, and selectable labels for both major and minor keys, (drawn entirely in CSS! see [Resources](#Resources) below) which spins to center the circle at the selected key.
## TODO
---
- [ ] Change view between full circle and half-circle depending on screen dimensions (full circle for portrait orientation and half-circle for landscape).
- [ ] Be able to spin circle by pressing arrow keys, by touch (on touchscreens), or by pressing arrow buttons.
- [ ] Change the color of a sections of the staff to the color of a selected key
- [ ] Style key label hover/select
- [ ] Add a clef that stays stable while the circle spins.
- [ ] Be able to select/move to a random key.
