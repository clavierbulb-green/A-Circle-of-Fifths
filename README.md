# A CIRCLE OF FIFTHS (WIP)

A web page that features an interactive version of the [Circle of Fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths), written to have fun with music theory and practice CSS and Javascript (and perhaps Python, later on).

## Features
---
Currently, features a circle with a circular staff with the key-signatures of each key, and selectable labels for both major and minor keys, (drawn entirely in CSS! see [Resources](#Resources) below) which spins to center the circle at the selected key.
    
## TODO
---
- [x] 'Hollowing out' the center of the circle.
- [x] Add an 'inner ring' for minor keys.
- [x] Have the circle spin to focus and center a selected key.
- [x] Label each section with its corresponding key.
- [x] In the middle-most layer, add a continuous staff that loops around the circle, with corresponding key signatures for each key section.
- [ ] Add a clef that stays stable while the circle spins.
- [ ] Be able to select/move to a random key.
